# HealthStat_Suicide-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
In this Project, the use of Tableau to present both an eye-catching as  well as highly informative dashboard at a glance is demonstrated.

## About The Company
HealthStat Analytics is aglobal health analytics company committed to understanding and addressing mental health challenges.
The company is currently facing difficulties in comprehensively analyzing globa lsuicide data to identify patterns, risk factors, anddemographic trends.
To address this, HealthStat Analytics aims to leverage Tableau for detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into global suicide trends and inform future public health initiatives.

## Problem Statement
HealthStat Analytics is struggling to gain comprehensive insights into global suicide patterns,including demographic factors, economic indicators, and generational trends.
There is a need to explore and visualize this complex dataset to extract meaningful insights for effective mental health interventions.
The objective is to use Tableau to perform a thorough exploratory data analysis on the suicide dataset, uncovering patterns, correlations, and trends to inform evidence-based public health strategies and interventions.

## Research Questions
Our analysis aims to answer the below research questions:
•How does suicide rates vary across countries and demographic groups?
•Are there notable trends in suicide rates based on age and gender?
•What is the correlation between economici ndicators(GDP) and suicide rates?
•How has the suicide rate changed over time in different countries?
•Can we identify countries or regions with particularly high or low suicide rates?
